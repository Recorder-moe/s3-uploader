# S3 Blob Storage Uploader

This script automates the process of uploading *.mp4 files from a local folder to S3 Blob Storage **and delete them** from the local folder. It utilizes the [MinIO Client(mc)](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/reference/minio-mc.html) to perform the upload.

## Getting Started

1. Pull the Docker image from the registry:

   ```bash
   docker pull ghcr.io/recorder-moe/s3-uploader:latest
   ```

1. Run the Docker container, providing the search filter as a command:

   ```bash
   docker run -e S3_ENDPOINT="https://your-s3-endpoint" \
              -e S3_ACCESS_KEY="your-s3-access-key" \
              -e S3_SECRET_KEY="your-s3-secret-key" \
              -e DESTINATION_BUCKET="your-bucket" \
              -e DESTINATION_DIRECTORY="your/destination/directory" \
              ghcr.io/recorder-moe/s3-uploader:latest video
   ```

   Replace `https://your-s3-endpoint` `your-s3-access-key`, `your-s3-secret-key`, `your-bucket`, and `your/destination/directory` with your desired values. The `video` argument is the search filter for the *.mp4 files to upload.

   The environment variables:

   - `S3_ENDPOINT`: The endpoint of the S3-compatible storage. For example, "https://s3.amazonaws.com".
   - `S3_ACCESS_KEY`: The access key for your S3-compatible storage.
   - `S3_SECRET_KEY`: The secret key for your S3-compatible storage.
   - `DESTINATION_BUCKET`: The name of the bucket in the S3-compatible storage where you want to upload the files.
   - `DESTINATION_DIRECTORY`: The directory path within the destination bucket where you want to upload the files. (No slash at the beginning or end)

1. The script will upload the matching files to S3 Blob Storage and **delete them** from the local folder.

> **Note**\
> Take a look at the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file for an example of how to run the container with Docker Compose.

## Notes

- This script is written in sh syntax and has been tested in docker image only.
- I am a novice in sh script, and I used ChatGPT to create it, including this README file.ðŸ˜Ž
